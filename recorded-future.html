  <p class="intro">
    This page shows how I think about Recorded Future and a Minnesota/Iowa territory through a Gap Selling lens:
    the problems security teams face, the business impact of those problems, and the root causes that keep them
    there, plus how I would build a focused top‑50 account plan.

              SIEM and EDR generate high volumes without risk-based prioritization, and threat intelligence is not integrated or lacks real-time scoring, so analysts guess what matters.

          Minnesota and Iowa have a strong mix of Fortune‑1000‑scale organizations across healthcare, financial
          services, utilities, manufacturing, and retail. In Minnesota alone there are more than a dozen Fortune
          500 and additional Fortune 1000 headquarters, including large retailers, banks, food companies, and
          utilities.

          My first step would be to segment the territory into a focused list of 50 anchor accounts that match
          Recorded Future’s sweet spot: complex attack surface, brand and third‑party risk, and existing
          investments in SIEM, EDR, and SOAR where intelligence can plug in quickly.
