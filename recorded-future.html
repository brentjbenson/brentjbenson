  <h1>Recorded Future: Gap view of the territory</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    This page shows how I think about Recorded Future and a Minnesota/Iowa territory through a Gap Selling lens:
    the problems security teams face, the business impact of those problems, and the root causes that keep them
    there, plus how I would build a focused top‑10 account plan.

      Threat intelligence only matters if it changes outcomes. Here is how I map Recorded Future to common

              and drives burnout on the team. [web:156][web:160]
            </td>
            <td>
              Tools generate lots of raw signals with little context, and intelligence is not integrated into

            </td>
            <td>
              Threat data lives in silos, reports are manual, and there is no shared view that connects threat
              activity to assets, brands, and key business services. [web:157][web:160]

              No centralized threat intelligence layer, limited historical context, and little automation in

    <div class="two-column">

        <p>
          Minnesota and Iowa have a strong mix of Fortune‑1000‑scale organizations across healthcare, financial
          services, utilities, manufacturing, and retail. In Minnesota alone there are more than a dozen Fortune
          500 and additional Fortune 1000 headquarters, including large retailers, banks, food companies, and
          utilities. [web:172][web:175]
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">
          My first step would be to segment the territory into a focused list of 10 anchor accounts that match
          Recorded Future’s sweet spot: complex attack surface, brand and third‑party risk, and existing
          investments in SIEM, EDR, and SOAR where intelligence can plug in quickly.

            Start with Fortune‑500/1000 headquarters in Minnesota and Iowa in sectors like healthcare, finance,
            utilities, manufacturing, and retail, then filter for size of digital footprint and regulatory pressure.

          <h3>Use public signals as clues</h3>
          <p>
            Look at open roles (SOC, IR, TI), tech mentions in job posts, recent incidents in their sector, and
            current partners to infer maturity and urgency, then pair that with RF intelligence. [web:162][web:165][web:168]

            recent threat activity, not a generic threat intelligence pitch.

      In my own planning, I’d build this out for 10 specific Minnesota and Iowa Fortune‑1000‑scale accounts, then
      map MEDDPICC fields on top of it: metrics, economic buyer, champions, and decision process for each logo.
