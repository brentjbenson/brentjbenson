      Saviynt aligns well to Gap Selling-style problems, impacts, and root causes across traditional IGA, Zero Trust, M&A,

              Identity teams spend a large share of their time on manual provisioning, access changes, and review prep, and access
              delays cause work interruption at scale. Automating IGA workflows can significantly reduce manual effort and avoid
              large amounts of lost productivity in a mid-to-large enterprise.
            </td>
            <td>
              Legacy IGA limited to on-prem apps and batch processes, spreadsheet and email-based certifications with no risk-based

              Perimeter-centric security with identity policies added piecemeal, no unified risk scoring for identities and entitlements,

          For Saviynt in Minnesota, I would focus on 40–50 larger enterprises and upper mid-market organizations where identity and

          The goal is to build a rolling list of priority accounts across healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, retail, and

              High volume of identity changes and seasonal workforce leading to access drift and manual reviews; Saviynt can automate

              Growing number of human and non-human identities across cloud and SaaS, with limited governance; Saviynt can provide

      In practice, I’d track these 40–50 Minnesota enterprises in a simple view that maps MEDDPICC fields, current IAM/IGA and ERP
