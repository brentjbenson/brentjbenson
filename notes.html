      <h2>What framing a roof taught me about building a territory</h2>
      <p class="meta">Personal project · Sales mindset</p>
      <p>
        When I started framing a roof overhang, I learned very fast that looks can be tricky. From the ground, it
        seemed like a small project. Once I got into measurements, pitch, and lumber, I saw how much planning it
        really needed. If I guessed or rushed, the roof would sag or pull away from the house later.
      </p>
      <p>
        A sales territory is the same way. On paper, it can look simple. You see a list of accounts and think you
        just need more calls or more emails. But when you look closer, every account has its own weight and its
        own history. If you do not plan for that, the whole thing can feel crooked and unstable.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the roof, I had to ask basic questions. How long will each board be. Where do the studs line up. How
        will this hold in wind and snow. In sales, I ask similar basic questions. Who are the real people I must
        reach. What problems do they care about. How does this deal help their business, not just my quota.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the overhang was finally up, it felt solid and clean. It would not win any design awards, but it did
        its job and will last. That is what I want from a territory plan. It does not need to be fancy. It needs
        to be real, repeatable, and able to hold more weight over time without falling apart.

      <h2>Scouting, trust, and long sales cycles</h2>
      <p class="meta">Scouting · Relationships</p>
      <p>
        Working with Scouts taught me a lot about trust. If I say we will be off the trail by dark, they watch to
        see if that happens. If I promise to listen to their ideas, they notice if I talk over them. Little moments
        matter. Over time, those moments tell them if they can count on me or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long sales cycles feel very similar. A customer will not trust me only because I have a title or a logo.
        They watch the small things. Do I call when I say I will. Do I follow up with clear notes. Do I admit it
        when I do not know an answer. Each touch either adds a small brick of trust or takes one away.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Scouts, I try to make every step a bit easier for them. I help them read the map, but I let them
        choose the route. I show them how to pack, but they carry their own gear. In sales, I try to do the same
        thing. I make the next step clear. I help the customer see the problem and options. I do not try to carry
        the whole decision for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In both settings, trust does not show up all at once. It grows slowly when people see that I care about
        them, not just the outcome. That is why I treat each email, call, and meeting like a small chance to prove
        I am on their side. When a big decision finally comes, that long line of small choices is what makes yes
        possible.
